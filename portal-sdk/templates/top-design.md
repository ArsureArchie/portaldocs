# Design patterns for common Azure scenarios

These design patterns provide solutions for common scenerios in Azure.  In Azure, we formalize these best practices once several teams have a similar problem, use a well researched shared approach and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design patterns to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

The following patterns are available

# Resource Management
The resource management patterns provide guidance for managing the full lifecycle of Azure resources.

1. Resource Create [design-patterns-resource-create.md](design-patterns-resource-create.md)

2. Resource Browse [design-patterns-resource-browse.md](design-patterns-resource-browse.md)

3. Resource Manage [design-patterns-resource-manage.md](design-patterns-resource-manage.md)
